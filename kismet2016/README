README for kismet2016

NOTE

    This is the final Ncurses version of Kismet that was released in
    2016. Afterwhich they changed to a web based version.

    To use kismet, you will need to copy the kismet.conf.orig and the
    kismet_drone.conf.orig to kismet.conf and kismet_drone.conf.  The
    configuration directory is located at /usr/etc. You must edit the
    configuration files if you wish for kismet to operate.

    This is a suid install, so it can be launched as a normal user.
    Running kismet as root is highly discouraged.

    If you wish for the audio chimes, then optionally you can install
    sox.
