Enabling Intel microcode updates

Microcode must be loaded by the bootloader.
These updates must be enabled by adding /boot/early-ucode.cpio as the *FIRST* initrd in the bootloader config file.
This is in addition to the normal initrd file, if you are using one.

GRUB2

- Automatic method

grub-mkconfig will automatically detect the microcode update and configure GRUB appropriately.
After installing the intel-ucode package, regenerate the GRUB config to activate loading the microcode update by running:

# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

- Manual method

Alternatively, manually add /boot/early-ucode.cpio to grub.cfg, so
it looks similar to below:

echo    'Loading Linux 4.15.3 ...'
linux   /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.3 root=/dev/sdb1 ro rootfstype=ext4 rootfstype=ext4 quiet
echo    'Loading intel microcode ...'
initrd  /boot/early-ucode.cpio $OTHER_INITRD

You'll have to do it for every kernel you have,
so the use of the automagic method is reccomended.

SYSLINUX
---

For syslinux, you will need to manually edit the configuration file /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg.
Following the APPEND line insert the initrd line. It will look something like this. Please take into consideration that it must be the first initrd in the bootloader configure file. Separate them with with a comma and no spaces.

LABEL CRUX
        LINUX ../vmlinuz
        APPEND root=/dev/sda2 rw 
        INITRD ../boot/early-ucode.cpio
