REQUIREMENTS:

PRECAUTION:

1. DON'T RUN BIND AS UID ROOT OR NOBODY !
2. If you need only a caching/forwarding DNS server for your
   small local network don't use bind for this. Dnsmasq is the 
   suitable program for this application. You can find a port 
   for dnsmasq under /usr/ports/contrib/dnsmasq.
