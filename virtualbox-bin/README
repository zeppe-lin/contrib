README for virtualbox-bin


PRECAUTION

    If you have any machines in a saved state it is recommended that
    you shut them down before updating this package.


NOTE

    If you wish for the Virtual Box drivers to be loaded on boot then
    edit /etc/rc.local config file and add something similar to this.

    if [ -f /sbin/rcvboxdrv ]; then
        rcvboxdrv start
    fi

VBOXSDL

    VBoxSDL is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that lacks
    the nice point-and-click support which VirtualBox (main GUI),
    provides. VBoxSDL is currently primarily used internally for
    debugging VirtualBox and therefore not officially supported.

    If you want to use VBoxSDL, install `libsdl'.
